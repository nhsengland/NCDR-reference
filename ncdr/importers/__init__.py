    Convert the given file from binary to a 'Windows - 1252' text file.

    The files uploaded come from a system which generates them with 'Windows -
    1252' encoding.  We've stored those behind Django's models.FileField which
    returns a models.FieldFile when accessed.  This class also opens the file
    for us to try and be helpful, however it opens the files in binary mode
    which is less than helpful.  This method re-encodes the file by reading it
    into StringIO which quacks like a File.
